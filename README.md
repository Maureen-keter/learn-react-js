Author: Lorena M

## Introduction

Welcome to the React Learning Guidelines. This document serves as a comprehensive guide for people looking to learn React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Git, a version control system.

## Purpose

The purpose of these guidelines is to provide a structured approach to learning React and Git, allowing groups to:

- Gain a solid understanding of React, its core concepts, and best practices.
- Learn how to effectively use Git for version control, collaboration, and project management.
- Work on a hands-on mini project to apply what you've learned in a real-world context.

## Sample Mini Project Idea

### Task Manager

Create a simple task manager application where users can add, edit, and delete tasks. The application should have multiple views, including a task list and a task details view. Users can click on a task to view and edit its details. The tasks should be stored in the application's state, and you can style it using a CSS framework or library. For an extra challenge, you can implement task prioritization or task categories.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your computer:

- Node.js (for React development)
- Git (for version control)

### Project Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Skylar-Lorena/learn-react-js.git` 

2.  Change your working directory to the project folder:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `cd learn-react-js 
    
3.  Start your React project by following the instructions in the "Learning Modules" section.
    

## Learning Modules

### Day 1: Setting Up the Project

-   Task 1: Create a new React project using `create-react-app`.
-   Task 2: Set up the project structure and understand the basic files generated.
-   Task 3: Initialize a Git repository for version control.

**Day 2: Building the User Interface**

-   Task 4: Design the basic user interface of the application using React components.
-   Task 5: Create a header component, navigation, and layout structure.
-   Task 6: Add placeholders for future content.

**Day 3: Implementing Core Features**

-   Task 7: Implement the core features of your application. For example, add features for creating, updating, and deleting tasks.
-   Task 8: Use React Router to create different views for your app (e.g., task list, task details).

**Day 4: State Management and Data Handling**

-   Task 9: Implement state management using React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.
-   Task 10: Create and manage state for various components in your application.
-   Task 11: Set up data handling for your application, such as storing task data in state.

**Day 5: User Interaction and Styling**

-   Task 12: Implement event handling for user interactions (e.g., clicking a task, editing task details).
-   Task 13: Style your application using CSS or a UI library like Material-UI.
-   Task 14: Ensure the application has a polished and visually appealing look.

### Day 6: Testing, Debugging, and Deployment

-   Task 15: Perform testing and debugging to ensure the application is error-free.
-   Task 16: Polish the project, review the code, and make any necessary improvements.
-   Task 17: Deploy your React application to a hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages).
